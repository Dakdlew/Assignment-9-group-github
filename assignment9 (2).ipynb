    "Scape one or more websites to build a list of the men's football (2019) and women's softball (2018-2019) games played in the thie Big Ten. This data needs to be turned into a database with three tables:\n",
    "1. __Matches__: a table which describes the matches such as when and where they happened, the teams which played, the results of the match. Basically, I want the data from these sites:\n",
    "* https://bigten.org/stats.aspx?path=football&year=2019#results\n",
    "* https://bigten.org/confstandings.aspx/2018-19/soft?path=softball#standings\n",
    "* https://bigten.org/confschedule.aspx/2018-19/soft?path=softball\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Plays__: for football, I'd like a table which describes who scored, and when, which should include a time, the team which scored, and so forth. Basically, I want the data from this site: \n",
    "* https://bigten.org/boxscore.aspx?id=r8jpms5mt9YevtitGgQBy0ei0qXBGKLTtZjhwPYJuA0PKfPkGJBtbwMLxCqWiCQNRUwEQ6PljW0jmgJb%2fgercesJ7CrNhXcHB14V5csY8AzyrdfPfeeoo8xrXAxNEkdv&path=football\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Universities__: a table which describes the universities which have teams in the sports. The pertinent numbers I'm interested in are the location of the university (state and geo-coordinates), when it was established, the endowment, and the number of students. You can get this kind of information from the right hand box in wikipedia, e.g.:\n",
    "* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this should be loaded into a database where the `Matches` table has foreign keys into the `Universities` table and the `Plays` table (for football) has foreign keys into the `Matches` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tips:\n",
    "* __Divide and conquer__: You have the whole class as a team, think about the scraping of the two sports as well as the plays and university details as separate tasks.\n",
    "* __Keep it simple__: You need to get the info neccessary to answer a few queries (below), nothing more. Don't try and build a whole content management system.\n",
    "* __Many ways to skin a cat__: There are several tools you can use to accomplish this, including:\n",
    "  * `pd.read_html` to turn HTML into `DataFrame`\n",
    "  * `DataFrame.to_sql` to turn `DataFrame` into SQL stables\n",
    "  * selenium (hard but comprehensive) or beautiful soup/requests (moderate) or even scrapy to scrape data\n",
    "  * save pages to local files and work on those files (this is fine!)"
